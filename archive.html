     <b>10th September 2006</b> - 
     Although I should have done some work on the 205 this weekend I ended up playing with the 306! It needed new brakes so I opted for an upgrade to GTi6 discs/calipers which fit straight on, pics of that install are <a href="gti6brakes.html">here</a>... I also have been wanting to replace the dented wing ever since I got the car over a year ago now, and I finally got around to it after picking up a Sigma Blue wing from eBay, fitting was quite easy and some pics are <a href="newwing.html">here</a>.<br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
     <b>7th September 2006</b> - 
     Finally got the 205 down to Merlin @ Combe to have the oil pipes made up... cost a packet but it's the best you can get and looks awesome! A few pics <a href="rebuild.html">here</a>... <br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
     <b>30th August 2006</b> - 
     Brake Bias valve now fitted (about 90%) and fire extinguisher also fitted, just the pipe to go on both but that will be after the interior is re-painted this weekend, updates <a href="rebuild.html">here</a>... <br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
     <b>29th August 2006</b> - 
     Started fitting the fire extinguisher and brake bias valve, updates <a href="rebuild.html">here</a>... <br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
     <b>28th August 2006</b> - 
     Made some good progress over the past few weeks and all the update pictures and write up are <a href="rebuild.html">here</a>... Off to Merlin Motorposrt later this week to get the dry sump pipes made up and hopfully the brake lines and fuel lines :)<br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
     <b>14th August 2006</b> - 
      Although I've not been updating the homepage here I have been updating the rebuild page <a href="rebuild.html">here</a>... Basically the rad has been lowered and the dry sump pipe run has almost been worked out. Immediate shopping list is an oil cooler and a Pacet rad fan.<br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
     <b>30th July 2006</b> - 
      Borrowed an engine crane over the weekend and dropped in the new engine to the track car. This is only a 'dry run' fit at the moment, to work out some pipe runs etc. Engine looks SERIOUSLY good in there though, also highlights the need to re-paint the gearbox in gloss black like the block! Some pics are <a href="rebuild.html">here</a>...<br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
     <b>25th July 2006</b> - 
      Curiosity got the better of me and I just had to see if the new 205 would start up, I knew it cranked but it was clear tha after 3+ years of being parked up there was no trace of any fuel in the system. So £5 later and some fuel in the tank and 20 seconds of cranking and it starts up! There is a short movie of it running <a href="movies/205start.avi">here</a> and some pictures of the underside of the car <a href="new205.html">here</a>...<br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
	  <b>24th July 2006</b> - 
    Busy weekend saw a visit to Castle Combe for the 2006 Rally Day, not as good as previous years and a pretty poor turnout for track action. The weather was a little varied with sun, then heavy rain on and off all day! Still got some pictures which are available <a href="rallyday06.html">here</a>... Sunday was much more eventful with a trip over to Stevenage to collect another 205 that is intended to be a new shell for the track car. It's a 1991 'J' plate 1.6 in Graphite Grey (same as my current track car) but most importantly it's a non-sunroof shell! It's totally complete but bought as a non-runner as it's been left to sit for almost 4 years!! Engine turns over but there is no fuel there at all, will see if it does start though before it's stripped down... loads of pictures are <a href="new205.html">here</a> and there is a movie of one of the rarest sights of any 205 GTi, a working coin tray, available <a href="movies/cointray.avi">here</a>!<br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
     <b>17th July 2006</b> - 
     Spent a bit of time over the weekend getting the engine ready to be dropped in with some updated pictures <a href="rebuild.html">here</a>... I would have got more done but decided to go to the Air Tattoo @ Fairford on Sunday, pictures from that to follow!<br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
     <b>11th July 2006</b> - 
     Finally got my 205 back from GwynneSPEED last night with the new seat rails fitted and some extra roll cage (T45 no less!) welded in across the back section for my harnesses. I also got hold of my repaired 4-2-1 Mi16 manifold and wrapped that again in exhaust wrap, horrible horrible stuff to work with and there are parts of the manifold that are so close you can't get the wrap around it. It also doesn't leave your manifold in the best condition and tends to help it rust, but by god it's excellent at keeping the engine bay temperatures down! Pics of the latest progress <a href="rebuild.html">here</a>...<br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
     <b>9th July 2006</b> - 
     There was an outside possibility that I would get my 205 back from GwynneSPEED at the weekend, that didn't happen though :( So decided to remove the rear spoiler from the 200SX as we all think they look LOTS better without them. Unfortunately our boot has the same issue most S13's have in that it's rusted on the 2 center clips! Well, we pulled it off anyhow and the pics are <a href="s13spoiler.html">here...</a> We've just covered the holes with gaffer tape for now, and it looks real good from a distance! We then took the car out for a bit of a drive and took some nice footage or a donut, some pathetic attempts of drifting round a bit roundabout and a nice summers evening drive though some wooded roads, you can download the movie <a href="movies/s13play.mov">here</a>...<br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
     <b>3rd July 2006</b> - 
     Well what a busy weekend it's been! First off there was the Cheltenham SXOC meet at the Gloucester Old Spot on Saturday afternoon (before the football of course) and some pics of that are <a href="s13meet1.html">here...</a> Then on Sunday it was the annual Pugfest event at Prescott Hill Climb held by the PSOOC. As my 205 is still out of action I took the 200SX along and even gave it a couple of runs up the hill! All went well except on the second run when a boost pipe blew off, fortunately an easy fix. There are some <a href="track24.html">pictures here</a> and some <a href="movie24.html">movies here</a> including some donuts we did afterwards to get used to the car. It's still so new to me that I'm not that confident in the drifting/donut thing yet so more practice required, though after that little go it seems stupidly easy to get the back end out on the car, great fun!!<br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
     <b>29th June 2006</b> - 
     Now the Stage 1 mods have been completed on the 200SX it was time to see what improvements had been made by getting it back on the dyno. PowerStation was the obvious choice so first thing this morning we get the car back on there... since sorting the timing from the last dyno run we know that the massive dip at 4k has gone, and since setting up the boost to 1.1bar the car has felt very much better than before, so we were expecting a decent power increase, and we weren't disappointed! The pictures, movie and dyno graph can be see <a href="s13dyno2.html">here...</a> but the results were 258bhp and 242lb/ft, an increase of 44bhp and 62 lb/ft... if only 205 tuning were this easy!!<br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
     <b>25th June 2006</b> - 
     With the 205 away we decided to get on and fit the full 'Stage 1' kit to the S13 along with a FMIC. Fortunately the car was already fitted with a Stage 1 chip and a turbo-back exhaust so all we had to do were fit cooler plugs, air filter, fuel pump and a boost controller set to ~15psi. We had also got hold of a SAAB Intercooler which can be fitted in place just in front of the radiator, with the correct pipe work it fits quite nicely! We also took the change to remove the Air-Con seeing as it's never worked and weighs a fair bit. Loads of pictures of the mods are available <a href="stage1.html">here...</a> we just need to set the boost up to 15psi and get the car back on the rollers!<br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
     <b>22nd June 2006</b> - 
     Engine bay now has 3 coats of paint and 3 coats of lacquer so it looking really very nice now! With that done the car is now off with GwynneSPEED for the seat rails so won't be any updates for a while now... but latest pics uploaded <a href="rebuild.html">here...</a><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
     <b>20th June 2006</b> - 
     Added a couple more coats of paint on the engine bay last night and cleaned/painted some more parts, updates <a href="rebuild.html">here...</a><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
    <b>19th June 2006</b> - 
     The momentum on the 205 is now beginning to pick up on the 205 and this weekend saw a major step forward with the engine bay cleaned, prepped and painted in Graphite Grey, the results of which can be seen <a href="rebuild.html">here</a>... A visit to Merlin Motorsport also saw the first few bits bought for the dry sump installation and the internal brake lines.<br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
    <b>15th June 2006</b> - 
     After dropping my spare Mi16 engine off with Matt @ <a href="http://www.q-e-p.co.uk/" target="_blank">QEP</a> in December 2005 I got the call earlier in the week that the new engine was finally complete. A 320 mile round trip saw me pick up what has turned out to be a stunning looking engine with quite a high spec. I hadn't revealed the spec before as I wasn't sure what it would end up being, as I was taking Matt's advice along the way... my only brief being that I wanted a solid 220bhp, I have a feeling that we may easily surpass that but we shall have to see!<br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>The full engine spec and lots of pictures are available <a href="raceengine.html">here</a>... Time to get a move on and finish up the rest of the car, aiming for it back together and ready for mapping in 4 weeks.<br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="15"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
    <b>13th June 2006</b> - 
     Got my 205 back into a rolling shell last night after fitting the hubs with new wheel bearings and the nicely cleaned front subframe... some pics have been added to the page <a href="rebuild.html">here</a>... so it's off to Gywnnespeed next for some bits and bobs!<br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
    <b>12th June 2006</b> - 
     Today the project 200SX had a date with a rolling road, obviously the PowerStation dyno as we work above it so it's nice and easy! We weren't expecting great things as the cars done 190k miles and had been sat for 18 months. There were already a few mods on the car, the turbo back exhaust and a Stage 1 chip, also we'd drilled the standard airbox out but other than that it seemed pretty standard. I thought the boost was running a little more than standard and this was proved on the rollers... a nice 214bhp and 181lb/ft were produced at 0.8 bar! So all seems good... until you look at the graph and see the MASSIVE dip at around 4k rpm and there is some cause for concern. A PDF of the graph is available <a href="K106XJB.pdf">here</a>. We have a few things to sort out so hopefully that will solve the dip... aiming to get back on the dyno in the next couple of weeks once we've done the other mods to the car.<br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><b>7th June 2006</b> - 
    <b>8th June 2006</b> - 
     Just incase anyone worried that the 205 is falling by the side, work has continued on this and with the news the the new engine is finally ready for collection things will start moving much quicker. I'll be keeping <a href="rebuild.html">this page</a> updated as things progress so check back if you want to know the latest!<br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><b>7th June 2006</b> - 
    <b>7th June 2006</b> - 
    Had a good look over the 200SX last night and came across a major bit of luck... turns out the ECU has already got a <a href="http://www.horsham-developments.co.uk/" target="_blank">Horsam Developments</a> Stage 1 chip fitted! We were going to be getting one of those soon anyhow but this has saved us around £100 which is superb! We also did the free airbox modification of removing the 'S' pipe and drilling the bottom of the airbox. Just got to remove the resonator box and hopefully there might be some induction noise. There is already a TIM (ick!) boost gauge fitted to the car and on that it seems to be producing 0.9 bar but I don't really trust such a cheap and nasty gauge so we'll check the boost properly on the dyno.<br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
     <b>6th June 2006</b> - 
     Insurance for the S13 now sorted, £220 TPFT for 3 of us to be on there... an utter bargain I say! Also got the car taxed so now we're all legal and have a nice little Jap motor ready for 12 months motoring for under £500, result! Though, we know it won't stop there... booked in on the dyno @ Powerstation on Monday and already have a FMIC and Walbro fuel pump on the way, and a quick trip to Forge will sort out the Air Filter and boost controller :)<br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
     <b>5th June 2006</b> - 
     MoT time for the S13 and much to our surprise it went straight through! There is one area of rust on the sill that had to be welded up but other than that everything else was fine! Though it wasn't fine at first, just before the MoT we discovered that the 75amp fuse for the alternator was blown, so after frantic search to get another one and it was all sorted. So now it's onto getting insurance and tax and we're away!<br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
     <b>2nd June 2006</b> - 
     After a bit of a random moment there is a new vehicle in the <font color="#669900"><b>md</font><font color="#FFFFFF">racing</b></font> stable... namley a 1992 Nissan S13 200SX. There are some pics and spec <a href="s13spec.html">here</a>... We picked it up for a bargain and the plan is to make it a cheap(!) track car to enjoy some sideways fun in. This is going to be a joint venture with myself, Adam Blacklock and Alan Hastings (we all make up the Maximum Designs crew). The S13 is in for it's MoT tomorrow so fingers crossed as it's been sat for over a year, although with a new battery it started first time!! <br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
     <b>31st May 2006</b> - 
     Things have been quiet this month, I've just been slowly preparing the car for the new engine. The new engine is almost complete, hoping to collect early June from Matt @ QEP. Until then I'll be fitting most of the dry sump kit, internal brake/fuel lines and plumbed in fire extinguisher!<br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
     <b>3rd May 2006</b> - 
     There have been a couple of updates to the Engine Removal page <a href="engineremoval.html">here</a>. The bottom end is appart and all the glorious shiny metal we found in the sump was nice!<br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
     <b>27th Apr 2006</b> - 
     Lots more progress made on the engine removal, and we're now in a position to take the engine out which should only take a half hour or so now! Details and pictures of last nights progress now updated <a href="engineremoval.html">here</a>.<br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br><img src="images/linesm.gif"><br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="5"><br>
     <b>26th Apr 2006</b> -
