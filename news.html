                    <p>Turns out much as expected, the car is going perfeclty and give a peak of <b>531 bhp</b> (vs. 537 in June) though torque was down to <b>479 lb/ft</b> (vs. 515 in June) but that's pretty much to do with the boost being much lower. Peak today was arond 1.7 bar with it holding at 1.5 for most of the run and rising to 1.6/1.7 just when all the timing then got pulled and the torque drops. In June the boost bas the same shape line but just 0.2 bar higher all along, so holding 1.7 bar and rising to 1.8/1.9 bar - <a href="gallery_rs4_ps_dyno_8.html">view gallery</a></p>

                    <p>Firstly I have to say that track is HARD to get used to for the first time - at 2.69 miles a lap and with lots of undulations there's a lot to take in and remember. Took a few sessions to even get close to enjoying it, it's been a good while since I've been to a "new" track as it were. But, come the third session I was beginning to find my stride and start enjoying it. It really is a stunning track and one that I would certainly go back to - <a href="gallery_rs4_oulton_park.html">view gallery</a></p>

Started off on the rear badges, and I can confirm this stuff really does just pull off as easily as everyone says! Then moved onto the grille and here I decided to coat the entire RS4 badge for now, but could peel off the coating from the red square if I fancy... same on the rear, have left it all black but could remove the red square. Then it was onto the mirrors and exhaust. Just a case of masking up the mirrors and with the exhaust it was given a good clean and degrease. There's difference of opinion if Plastidip is OK for exhaust tips but if not it will just break down and would be easy enough to remove. Figures it best to do the tips as with no CAT's they turbo mostly black soon after they are cleaned anyhow - <a href="gallery_rs4_plastidip_trim.html">view gallery</a></p>

I never really planned to keep them in that condition and indeed after a week’s use the fronts were badly marked from the DS2500 brake dust, as you can see from the pics below. Yes, those have been cleaned very well and that's staining that's been left! A while back I started to hear about this stuff called <a href="http://www.plastidip.co.uk/" target="_blank">Plastidip</a> which has been around for some time now but only in the past few years have people started to use it on vehicle parts. Whilst the colour range of the spray cans are a bit limiting I thought I'd just give it a go with the straight black and see how it went. The idea of this stuff is that it's pretty simple to remove, you just peel it off... well time will tell about that but there are plenty of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=plastidip" target="_blank">YouTube videos about Plastidip</a> so go take a look - <a href="gallery_rs4_plastidip_sportec_wheels.html">view gallery</a></p>

Being October it's a bit risky with the weather and Sunday didn't disappoint, it was cooooold (good for engines) and a little damp (not good for traction).

They are a bit of a "marmite" wheel, some people loving them and some hating them and at first I was on the fence about them... having now got them on the car though, I love them!! Went with the 9.5" x 18" as they aren't available in 19" yet and had to have the ET40 - not ideal as I only had 16mm spacers available so in the pictures below they are 4mm further IN than standard wheels (though are 1" wider then OEM size). Also decided to go for a little bit of stretch on the tyres so went for some Falken 452 225/40/18 which I think are OK. Car was also dropped another 10/15mm though ideally it needs to be an Air now to get the look just right... as for whether I'll do that, not sure but never say never!! - <a href="gallery_rs4_3sdm_005_wheels.html">view gallery</a></p>

Our first few runs out we took it easy to just get used to the sensation of driving so fast on a runway (it's quite surreal!) and getting used to breaking in what felt like no where near enough space! Rick was alos just checking the settings in the high boost map to ensure everything was running perfect, and it was all spot on. He didn't need to adjust anything that was 'bad' as it were.

The plan had been to do a cheapy little airfield day (Abingdon) with a mate and his Type-R powered Lotus Elise, however that got sold out before we managed to book so we looked for an alternative on the same day. Using the handy website <a href="http://www.trackdays.co.uk/" target="_blank">www.trackdays.co.uk</a> we decided on an openpit event at Donington Park which is one of my favourite tracks, up there with Cadwell, and the day didn't disappoint. The weather was a mix of rain dry spells, thankfully enough for the track to dry out for a few sessions. Car performed flawlessly though I did get black flagged 3 laps into my first outing due to noise (0.4 dB over the 98.0 dB limit!) so that put an end of flat shifting and to be on the safe side I shifted around 6k rather than 7k - <a href="gallery_rs4_donington_august_2012.html">view gallery</a></p>

They are the 18 x 8.5 fitment and come with some natty spacers that bolt up inside giving the option of ET35 or ET15. For the B5 RS4 the OEM fitment it ET20 so going to ET15 doesn't present any issues (ET35 would suit the S4 and various other cars). They also came with a set of Goodyear F1 Asymmetrics in the OEM size of 255/35/18 which was a huge bonus really. The wheels had just been refurbished, but they had done a very poor job (hence the bargain they were!) so they look rubbish up close at present but a refurb and/or colour change are on the cards. I did wonder if they would be a little lighter than the OEM wheels but I weighed both (see pics below) and they both came out exactly the same with a tyre fitted so certainly zero weight saving in these wheels! - <a href="gallery_rs4_sportec_wheels.html">view gallery</a></p>

I'd fitted a full set of B7 RS4 front &amp; rear brakes with EBC Yellow Stuff pads almost a year ago now and whilst they were a superb improvement ove the OEM B5 RS4 brakes they just didn't feel 'that' good. This was really highlighted by a few track outings this year where after the first one I ditched the EBC's and went for some Ferodo DS2500 which are pricey but a big improvement over the EBC's. Then the last outing at Combe (which was the first with the DS2500's) the brakes felt better but still didn't feel amazing and wondering around the pits seeing many other VAG based cars with the same 8-pot caliper fitted I figured they can't be THAT bad! Then I got chatting with the UK rep for <a href="http://www.loba-motorsport.com" target="_blank">LOBA Motorsport</a>, a Germany based company, who had just finished off producing <a href="http://www.loba-motorsport.com/en/product-gallery/audi/rs-4/b7-42-v8-309-kw-420-ps-quattro/loba-b7-brake-disc-upgrade" target="_blank">uprated discs for the B7 RS4</a> so I decided to give them a go - <a href="gallery_rs4_loba_brake_discs.html">view gallery</a></p>

With Castle Combe as my "local" track it seemed perfect timing that Autometrix (publishers of Audi Driver and VW Driver) were organising a VAG Trackday. One quick phone call and a few sessions were booked! Weather this summer (if you can call it that!) has been shocking and sadly Combe was no no different. Rain was falling all morning ranging from steady to heavy until around 1pm so my first 2 sessions were in heavy rain but the 3rd session was just a wet track so really started to get a feel for the new power (ran the non-meth map but with the meth on for extra cooling) and start to gain confidence in the rather heavy beast - <a href="gallery_rs4_combe_july_2012.html">view gallery</a></p>

So I gave up on that and looked elsewhere. My options as I saw it were a Front Mounted Intercooler, which although appears cheap at first glance does require a large amount of work as on the B5 RS4 the oil cooler and PAS cooler need to be moved which means new ones and more expense.

Not an ideal situation as there is technically a bottle neck with going from smaller to larger. The solution was a 100mm aluminium trumpet sold by <a href="http://shop.grahamgoode.com/ggr-spun-aluminium-induction-kit-trumpet-100mm-ggr060100mm-63300-p.html" target="_blank">Graham Goode</a> which is a straight fit for the filter and just needed a 102mm to 89mm reducer from <a href="http://www.siliconhoses.com/content.html?inc=product&catalog=0022S&cat=0022S" target="_blank">SiliconHoses.com</a> to finish it off. Space is getting a little tight in there now so I re-fitted the trimmed 45deg hose to the Y-Pipe which gave a bit more space. The bigger trumpet was also longer so about 40mm was removed to ensure it would fit neatly - <a href="gallery_rs4_kn_induction.html#trumpet">view gallery</a></p>

We figured it must be some kind of dodgy pump regardless and changing it was the best course of action. Checking out the price of a new OEM pump we figured it was almost the same price to get a Bosch 044 pump (rated higher than the OEM pump) and the necessary basket/filter best suited to fit that pump. - <a href="gallery_rs4_adi_2011.html">view gallery</a></p>

Handily one of my contacts knows where to get them from and sorted me out with a set. They don't look like much, in fact they are really small compared to most injectors (the B5 RS4 taking a compact fitment) so in another way I'm glad I got them for a cracking price rather then what most resellers charge! - <a href="gallery_rs4_bosch_ev14_750cc.html">view gallery</a></p>

A common upgrade is to fit B7 RS4 front (and often rear) brakes as they are a superb option and look very OEM. Whist this is still an option I've been passed a set of Forge Motorsport 8-Pot Brakes which were fitted to a VW Scirocco that I'm going to see if I can make fit. - <a href="gallery_rs4_action_day_1.html">view gallery</a></p>

Weather wasn't great but the rain held off for the most part and a good time was had by all, I wasn't really planning to take the RS4 out on track but a couple of sessions were thrust at me so it would have been rude not to. The car was brilliant though it took me a while to get 'comfy' with the feel of such a large car on track, the last car I'd driven on track was my old 205 Mi16 so the RS4 is waaaaaaay different! Can see me taking it out on track again, though even with my current suspension setup it's a handful through the corners - more work required I feel... oh and brakes!! - <a href="gallery_rs4_action_day_1.html">view gallery</a></p>

Some people have fitted a boost gauge where the voltmeter is which is a really nice solution but a big commit to hack the gauges about, one I'm not quite prepared to do! So the next best gauge IMO is a PODI which I had imported from America. It's an electronic gauge with various colour illumination which can be used to match the OEM illumination nicely, hence they are a popular gauge with the VAG-set - <a href="gallery_rs4_boost_gauge.html">view gallery</a></p>

Standard knob when back on and the hunt begin to track down a knob of folk law and legend - an ESP Weighted Gear Knob. ESP closed down their road car product department a few years ago, hence their products hard to come by on the second hand market.

They are in need of a refurb and to fit the B5 RS4 they need some mods, mostly to do with the outlet pipes to match up with the intercoolers in the RS4. Some people have done these mods themselves, one persona having made up a jig to help with the alignment of the outlets, however I've been in discussion with Turbo Dynamics who are familiar with the necessary mods and will be carrying them out for me. They will also "fettle" with the turbos so they will eventually become Stage 1 RS6 turbos in a B5 RS4 fitment, nice - <a href="gallery_rs4_rs6_turbos.html">view gallery</a></p>

Whilst they are an upgrade over the S4 intercoolers, they are still fairly small and are also partly covered by the fog lights. Plans to remove the fog lights and fit replacement grills are already in the works but the ideal solution is to fit uprated intercoolers. I could have gone the FMIC route but on the RS4 that's quite a job with oil cooler and PAS cooler in the way so I've decided to fabricate my own sidemounts. First to arrive from a UK source (i.e. not China!) are the cores which are the same size as the Wagner cores - <a href="gallery_rs4_sidemounts.html">view gallery</a></p>
