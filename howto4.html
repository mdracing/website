     <b>Introduction</b><br>
     To me removing the gearbox and refitting it with the engine in the car sounded impossible and very tricky, but as it turns out it’s not that bad! Very useful if you need to swap a gearbox or just fit a new clutch. This is something possible on your own but having someone help you makes a few bits much easier, namely the refitting of the box!<br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="10"><br>

It’s quite close to the subframe so although it has a square size socket in there for the standard sump plug key there isn’t any room to use it! Fortunately Peugeot decided to make this drain plug with a nut style shape so just get a spanner to it and remove. (worth pointing out that some people don’t bother draining the gearbox this way and just let it empty when the drive shafts are removed, I find draining the box a much cleaner method!)</td>

We don’t need to completely remove the driveshafts from the car so that’s why we haven’t touched the big driveshaft nut by the hub. I find the easiest way to remove the driveshaft is to release the hub from the wishbone balljoint. Undo the nut (16mm) and tap out the bolt, then either using your weight or a leaver pry the wishbone away from the hub (you may also need to use a mallet to tap the wishbone free). This can be done to both sides, but removing the driveshafts themselves differs slightly each side.<br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="10"><br>
     		
     		WARNING: You may have great difficulty pulling at least one driveshaft out of the differential if you have managed to explode the diff (through lack of oil) – they seem to stick and can be a real pain!</td>

Move the whole strut assembly with driveshaft over a little and make sure not to damage the end of the driveshaft (I usually wrap a plastic bag around the end to stop dirt etc. sticking to it). <i>(pic 2)</i></td>

     		<td>The drivers driveshaft is a bit more fiddly as there is a bearing assembly housed in the rear engine mount that the driveshaft is bolted to. Slide under the car until your looking up at the rear engine mount. To the left of the mount you will see 2 threads sticking out with small nuts on. You need to undo those nuts (11mm) about an inch or so (no need to remove them, just make sure they are almost at the end – about 3-4mm). Take one of the threads in your hand, push towards the housing and then rotate about 90 degrees. The bolt is basically like a hook acting on the centre bearing and your spinning the hook off the bearing allowing it to be removed. Repeat this with the other thread. You should now be able to release the driveshaft from the gearbox. You may need to give the centre bearing a tap with a hammer and screwdriver or similar as if they haven’t been out in a long time they can seize in there a little. Once out of the gearbox try and hold the assembly out of the way, you won’t be able to move it that far as it’s so long. <br><img src="images/pix.gif" height="10"><br>
     		WARNING: Whatever you do don’t just yank the driveshaft from the hub end without releasing the centre bearing, you will simply pull the driveshaft apart. If it does come apart then you will need to act very quickly. There are 3 large bearings each supported by small roller bearings. The large bearings can fall off very easily, allowing the roller bearings to also drop off. They can be rebuilt, but its incredibly fiddly! The shaft will go back together again, but you need to slowly work it in to get the right angle – hitting it doesn’t work.</td>

This is located just to the front left of the gearbox under the inlet manifold. It’s a pain to get to but it’s possible. We don’t need to remove the starter completely, just remove the bolts holding it to the gearbox. There are 3 of these and they are normally Allen Head bolts. They are very long bolts so keep undoing until you can remove them. <i>(pic 4)</i></td>

To get the gearbox back up and mated to the engine get it sat back on the trolley jack and slide it in under the car, then either with some rope around the gearbox, or if you have long arms grab the gearbox from the top of the car and lift up (watch your back doing this). If you have a helper get them under the car (carefully!) to help guide the gearbox up and in. The gearbox needs to be twisted (diff upwards) to make it easier. Your aiming to get the input shaft beginning to slide back into the engine, as soon as it’s taken a couple of inches the heavy work is done!

It’s a bit fiddly but I use a funnel with a long nozzle (small gear oil containers have extensions that fit). It’s a good idea to put your oil drip tray under where your working as you will drop some oil. Continue to fill the box making regular checks to see if the oil is dripping back out yet. Once is starts dripping your done. If you go a bit too full let it pour back out of the box until it slows to a drip. Refit the bolt and your gearbox is now full of oil. <i>(pic 8)</i></td>
