      <b>Introduction</b><br />
     <a href="images/howto9/large/bushes.jpg" rel="lightbox[MD Racing]" title="Doug Whalen Z3 Seat Bushes"><img src="images/howto9/bushes.jpg" border="0" alt="click for large picture" align="right" hspace="10"></a>The seats in the BMW Z3 have an inherent design flaw which means that after time the seats start rocking back and forth on their mounts. It's not a massive movement and one that can often be hard to replicate by hand, but when your sat in the seat and come to a stop or pull off there is a slight movement in the seat back and forth. The design flaw is that a rubber bush is used in an integral area of the seat mechanism and obviously compresses over time allowing for movement. The cure, fitting nylon bushes in place of the rubber ones. They are a very simple bush and some people may even fabricate their own but a friendly American called Doug Whalen supplies the correct bushes for only a few dollars (and will ship to the UK free of charge). You can order direct from Doug here: <a href="http://www.whalenshiftmachine.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=3&products_id=8" target="_blank">www.whalenshiftmachine.com</a><br /><img src="images/pix.gif" height="10"><br />
     
     <b>Note</b><br />
     This guide is using my Z3 M Coupe with the leather sports seats as the basis for the guide and pictures. I believe the standard Z3 seats are similar though the seats mount slightly differently to the car and may have differing numbers of wire connections, though once out the rest of the guide is the same.<br /><img src="images/pix.gif" height="10"><br />

Mine weren't actually too bad though it still caused a rocking motion with the seat and I was able to rock the mount in my hand so it's clearly a bit of a design flaw. To get access to the rubber bush it's necessary to unwind the mount, so here it's important to make a note of how far down the rod the mount is positioned. I used some insulation tape and just wound it around the rod under where the mount was positioned, though as I was doing one side at a time I wasn't too bothered about how accurate the marking was. <i>(pic 6)</i></td>

Whether this was by mistake or on purpose this means it will be necessary to sand the bushes down until they are a tight fit. So with some sand paper or emory paper place it on a flat surface and then start rubbing away. I removed about the same from a pair of bushes for each side, and simply checked regularly until they started to slide into the mount. There have been different things said about how tight they should be, and I've rad of one person having to take his seats in and out 4 times as the adjusting mechanism wouldn't work for some reason. I only did it once, fitted them pretty tight and it seems fine so here you will just have to use your own judgement, there is no right or wrong way, only YOUR way. <i>(pic 9, 10 &amp; 11)</i></td>

     		<td>Now the new bushes are fitted to the mount simply wide it back onto the rod down to the marked position. The next step is probably the most fiddly of the entire job, fitting the rod back to the sliding mechanism and inserting the adjusting rod. The first time I did this it must have taken about 20 minutes or trial and error in trying to get it all back together, though I ended up with a fairly decent way of doing it in the end. So, with the sliding mechanism all the way back (to the same position when you removed the rod) insert the rod back into the mechanism and wiggle/push it down until it comes to a stop against the adjusting rod.</td>

However, there is a fair amount of movement in the rod so it doesn't just slide into place, it has to be fiddled with! I used a small flat head screwdriver to push the little rod down a little whilst at the same time pushing the larger rod onto it. There is a little square hole in the sliding mechanism that if you put it in the right place will give you a little access window to the area your trying to work on. It does take a lot of trial and error and you may find a better or alternative way of getting the 2 rods back together, but eventually it will all slot into place and the mounting holes will line up. When they do, pat yourself on the back and re-fit the T50 bolt and the 2 T20 bolts, and that's one side done! <i>(pic 12 &amp; 13)</i> </td>

Then the 13mm nuts, move the seat forward to fit the 16mm bolts and the seatbelt mount. Here it's important to check the seat does still slide back and forward. It may be a little more labored than before but that's due to the additional tightness we've added to the mechanism. Also, if the seat does seem to sit on it's mounting points properly you may have messed up aligning the seat runners when re-fitting them. Sadly it's a case of pulling the seat back out of the car and removing the rods to adjust how far up or down you wound the mount onto the rod, so lets just hope that doesn't happen!</td>
